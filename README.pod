=head2 Run website

You need to docker to run the website on your local machine.

You have to adjust docker-compose.yml to point to the right location to persist postgresql data if you want to 
persist it.

You also need to define some environment variables (set them to something random):

* DB_PASSWORD
* POSTGRES_PASSWORD

To start:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compouse up
```

After starting the website is available with http://127.0.0.1:8080/. 
The Admin area is located at http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/login. User and password is "admin" / "admin".
